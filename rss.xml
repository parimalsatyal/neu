	   <title>In Praise of Dive Watches</title>
			<description>A dive watch might seem an odd thing to write an eloge to, especially by someone who barely spends any time in water. However, I think the features that made dive watches great for suba diving in the 60s and the 70s are exactly those that make them particularly versatile and useful in everyday life today. </description>

	      <title>Rediscovering the Small Web</title>
				<description>Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement and 'convert'. But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but also creative and informative.</description>

  	    <title>Teaching Myself German</title>
  			<description>I had been somewhat obsessed with Germany for the past year or so but there, on a small street off Könnerlitzstraße in the backdrop of loud, bright fireworks and sekt-induced mirth, it was absolutely clear: I had to learn German.</description>

  	    <title>Island (At Long Last)</title>
  			<description>At Long Last began as a haiku but just kept on going. I'm not entirely sure where the dark overtones come from, nor the Siren theme. It's not like I often think about sea-dwelling homicidal nymphs.</description>

 	      <title>Retro Stuff</title>
 				<description>I grew up with the web of the 90s and early 2000s. With Geocities, FTP, Microsoft FrontPage, Netscape Navigator, CuteFTP, Winamp, Napster and personal websites. I often get nostalgic about all that. If you do too, you might enjoy this collection of things from that era.</description>
